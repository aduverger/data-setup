    - lowercase
    - no special characters
    - for example: `firstname`
- Choose a **password**
- Confirm your password

‚ö†Ô∏è When you type your password, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your password as a whole but also its length. Just type your password and when you're done, press `ENTER`.

You can close the Ubuntu window now that it is installed on your computer.

### Check the WSL version of Ubuntu

- Press `Windows` + `R`
- Type  `cmd`
- Press `Enter`

Type the following command:

```bash
wsl -l -v
```

‚úîÔ∏è If the version of Ubuntu WSL is 2, you are good to go üëç

‚ùå If the version of Ubuntu WSL is 1, we will need to convert it to version 2.

<details>
  <summary>Convert Ubuntu WSL V1 to V2</summary>

  In the Command Prompt window, type:

  ```bash
  wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
  ```

  ‚úîÔ∏è After a few seconds, you should get the following message: `The conversion is complete`.

  ‚ùå If it does not work, we need to be sure that Ubuntu files are not compressed.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Check for Uncompressed Files</summary>

  - Press `Windows` + `R`

‚úîÔ∏è If you see `WSL: Ubuntu` in a green box in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window, you're good to go üëç

![WSL Ubuntu Remote](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/windows_remote_wsl.png)

‚ùå Otherwise, please ask for help.


## Windows Terminal

### Installation

‚ÑπÔ∏è The following instructions depend on your version of Windows.

If you are running Windows 11, the Windows Terminal is already installed and you can proceed to the next section üëá

If you are running Windows 10, let's install Windows Terminal, a real modern terminal:

- Click on `Start`
- Type  `Microsoft Store`
- Click on `Microsoft Store` in the list
- Search for `Windows Terminal` in the search bar
- **Select Windows Terminal"**
- Click on `Install`

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT install **Windows Terminal Preview**, just **Windows Terminal**!

<details>
  <summary>Uninstall wrong version of Windows Terminal</summary>

  To uninstall a wrong version of Windows Terminal, you just have to go to the Installed Program List of Windows 10:

  - Press `Windows` + `R`
  - Type  `ms-settings:appsfeatures`
  - Press `Enter`

  Find the software to uninstall and click on the uninstall button.
</details>

Once the installation is finished, the `Install` button becomes a `Launch` button: click on it.

### Ubuntu as the default terminal

Let's make Ubuntu the default terminal of your Windows Terminal application.

Press `Ctrl` + `,`

It should open the terminal settings:

![Windows Terminal Settings](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/windows_terminal_settings.png)

- Change the default profile to "Ubuntu"
- Click on "Save"
- Click on "Open JSON file"

We have circle in red the part you will change:

![Windows Terminal JSON settings file](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/windows_terminal_settings_json.png)

First, let's ask Ubuntu to start directly inside your Ubuntu Home Directory instead of the Windows one:
- Locate the `"name": "Ubuntu",`
- Add the following line after it:

```bash
"commandline": "wsl.exe ~",
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not forget the comma at the end of the line!

Then, let's disable warning for copy-pasting commands between Windows and Ubuntu:
- Locate the line `"defaultProfile": "{2c4de342-...}"`
- Add the following line after it:

```bash
"multiLinePasteWarning": false,
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not forget the comma at the end of the line!

You can save these changes by pressing `Ctrl` + `S`

‚úîÔ∏è Your **Windows Terminal** is now setup üëç

This terminal has tabs: you can choose to open a new terminal tab by clicking on the **+** next to the current one.

**From now on, every time we will refer to the terminal or the console it will be this one.**


## VS Code Extensions

### Installation

Let's install some useful extensions to VS Code.

```bash
code --install-extension ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings
code --install-extension emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension KevinRose.vsc-python-indent
code --install-extension ms-python.vscode-pylance
code --install-extension ms-toolsai.jupyter
```

Here is a list of the extensions you are installing:
- [Sublime Text Keymap and Settings Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)

- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)


## Git

### Installation

[`git`](https://git-scm.com/) is a command line software used for version control.

To install `git`:
- Open a terminal
- Copy and paste the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git
```

These commands will ask for your password: type it in.

‚ö†Ô∏è When you type your password, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your password as a whole but also its length. Just type in your password and when you're done, press `ENTER`.

### GitHub CLI installation

Let's now install [GitHub official CLI](https://cli.github.com) (Command Line Interface). It's a software used to interact with your GitHub account via the command line.

In your terminal, copy-paste the following commands and type in your password if asked:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gh
```

To check that `gh` has been successfully installed on your machine, you can run:

```bash
gh --version
```

‚úîÔ∏è If you see `gh version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)`, you're good to go üëç

‚ùå Otherwise, please ask for help.


## zsh

Instead of using the default `bash` [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)), we will use `zsh`.

In a terminal execute the following command and type in your password if asked:

```bash
sudo apt install -y zsh curl vim imagemagick jq unzip
```


## Oh-my-zsh

Let's install the `zsh` plugin [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

In a terminal execute the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

If asked "Do you want to change your default shell to zsh?", press `Y`

At the end your terminal should look like this:

![Ubuntu terminal with OhMyZsh](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/images/oh_my_zsh.png)

‚úîÔ∏è If it does, you can continue üëç

‚ùå Otherwise, please ask for help.

### Zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin

In a terminal execute the following command:

```bash
export CURRENT_DIR=`pwd`
export ZSH_PLUGINS_DIR="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins"
mkdir -p "$ZSH_PLUGINS_DIR" && cd "$ZSH_PLUGINS_DIR"
if [ ! -d "$ZSH_PLUGINS_DIR/zsh-syntax-highlighting" ]; then
  git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
  git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
fi
cd "$CURRENT_DIR"
```

## GitHub CLI

CLI is the acronym of [Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

In this section, we will use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to interact with GitHub directly from the terminal.

It should already be installed on your computer from the previous commands.

First in order to **login**, copy-paste the following command in your terminal:

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT edit the `email`**

```bash
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```

You will get the following output:

```bash
! First copy your one-time code: 0EF9-D015
- Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Select and copy the code (`0EF9-D015` in the example), then press `ENTER`.

Your browser will open and ask you to authorize GitHub CLI to use your GitHub account. Accept and wait a bit.

Come back to the terminal, press `ENTER` again, and that's it.

To check that you are properly connected, type:

```bash
gh auth status
```

‚úîÔ∏è If you get `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME> `, then all good üëç

‚ùå If not, ask for help..

Then run the following configuration line:

```bash
gh config set git_protocol ssh
```


## SSH Key

### Generation

We need to generate SSH keys which are going to be used by GitHub to authenticate you. You can think of it as a way to log in, but different from the well known username/password pair.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you already generated keys that you already use with other services, you can skip this step.

Open a terminal and copy-paste this command, replacing the email with **yours** (the same one you used to create your GitHub account).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -o -a 100 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C "firstName.lastName@solution-bi.com"
```

It will prompt for information. Just press enter until it asks for a **passphrase**.

‚ö†Ô∏è When asked for a passphrase, put something you want and that you'll remember. It's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive.

‚ö†Ô∏è When you type your passphrase, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your passphrase as a whole but also its length. Just type your passphrase and when you're done, press `ENTER`.

### Giving your public key to GitHub

Now, you will give your **public** key to GitHub.

In your terminal copy-paste the following command:

```bash
gh auth refresh -s write:public_key
```

It will prompt a one time code (####-####) on the screen. Copy it and press `ENTER`, then paste the code in your browser and follow the instructions to **Authorize GitHub**.

Back in the terminal, press `ENTER` and run this:

```bash
gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

This should return `‚úì Public key added to your account`. If not, do not hesitate to ask for help..


## Dotfiles

Programmers love to refine and polish their shell and tools. We'll start with a great default configuration.

- Copy the content of the `gitconfig`, `aliases`, `profile`, `zprofile`, `zshrc` files into `~/.gitconfig`, `~/.aliases`, `~/.profile`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/.zshrc`.

- If some of these files do not exist on your computer, just create them. *TIPS*: You can easily modify or create a file by running the following command, for e.g. `code ~/.aliases`

- Copy the content of the `keybindings.json` and `settings.json` files into `~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/keybindings.json` and `~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json`

Then, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=`gh api user | jq -r '.login'`
echo $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

You should see your GitHub username printed. If it's not the case, **stop here** and ask for help.
There seems to be a problem with the previous step (`gh auth`).

Check the emails registered with your GitHub Account. You'll need to pick one at the next step:

```bash
gh api user/emails | jq -r '.[].email'
```

Copy-paste the following command, replacing the first name, last name and email with **yours**.

‚òùÔ∏è Be careful you **need** to put one of the email listed above thanks to the previous `gh api ...` command.

```bash
git config --global user.email "firstName.lastName@solution-bi.com"
git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
```
Please now **quit** all your opened terminal windows.


## Installing Python (with [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))

Ubuntu comes with an outdated version of Python that we don't want to use. You might already have installed Anaconda or something else to tinker with Python and Data Science packages. All of this does not really matter as we are going to do a professional setup of Python where you'll be able to switch which version you want to use whenever you type `python` in the terminal.

First let's install `pyenv` with the following Terminal command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
exec zsh
```

Ignore the `pyenv: no such command 'virtualenv-init' for now`.

Let's install some [dependencies](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/common-build-problems#prerequisites) needed to build Python from `pyenv`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev \
python-dev python3-dev
```

Let's install the [latest stable version of Python](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/) supported by this setup:

```bash
pyenv install 3.8.12
```

This command might take a while, this is perfectly normal. Go play a game of darts while you wait üéØ

OK once this command is complete, we are going to tell the system to use this version of Python **by default**. This is done with:

```bash
pyenv global 3.8.12
exec zsh
```

To check if this worked, run `python --version`. If you see `3.8.12`, perfect! If not, ask for help.


## Python Virtual Environment

Before we start installing relevant Python packages, we will isolate the data science setup into a **dedicated** virtual environment. We will use a `pyenv` plugin called [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv).

First let's install this plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv
exec zsh
```

Let's create the virtual environment we are going to use during the whole bootcamp:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.12 data
```

Let's now set the virtual environment with:

```bash
pyenv global data
```

Great! Anytime we'll install Python package, we'll do it in that environment.


## Python packages

Now that we have a pristine `data` virtual environment, it's time to install some packages in it.

First, let's upgrade `pip`, the tool to install Python Packages from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org). In the latest terminal where the virtualenv `data` is activated, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then let's install some packages for the first weeks of the program:

``` bash
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/specs/releases/linux.txt
```



## Configuring Jupyter Notebook to open in your browser

Let's generate the configuration file for **Jupyter Notebook**...

``` bash
jupyter notebook --generate-config
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Please copy the path returned by the previous command.

We will now edit the generated Jupyter configuration file:

``` bash
code $HOME/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
```

Locate the following line in the configuration file:

``` python
# c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = True
```

And replace it with this one:

``` python
c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = False
```

Let's try to run Jupyter:

``` bash
jupyter notebook
```

This command should have opened a Jupyter page in your browser. If it is not the case, please ask for help.

To stop the Jupyter server in the terminal, press `Ctrl` + `C`, enter y, then press Enter.


## `jupyter` notebook extensions

Pimp your `jupyter` notebooks with awesome extensions:

```bash
# install nbextensions
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main
jupyter nbextension enable collapsible_headings/main
jupyter nbextension enable spellchecker/main
jupyter nbextension enable code_prettify/code_prettify
```

### Custom CSS

Improve the display of the [`details` disclosure elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) in your notebooks.

Open `custom/custom.css` in the config directory:
```bash
cd $(jupyter --config-dir)
mkdir -p custom
touch custom/custom.css
code custom/custom.css
```
Edit `custom.css` with:

```css
summary {
    cursor: pointer;
    display:list-item;
}
summary::marker {
    font-size: 1em;
}
```

You can close VS Code.

### `jupyter` check up

Let's reset your terminal:

```bash
exec zsh
```

Now, check you can launch a notebook server on your machine:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Your web browser should open on a `jupyter` window. Click on `New`. A tab should open on a new notebook.

### `nbextensions` check up

Perform a sanity check for `jupyter notebooks nbextensions`. Click on `Nbextensions`:

![jupyter_nbextensions.png](img/nbextensions1.png)

Untick _"disable configuration for nbextensions without explicit compatibility"_ then check that _at least_ all `nbextensions` circled in red are enabled:

![nbextensions.png](img/nbextensions2.png)

You can close your web browser then terminate the jupyter server with `CTRL` + `C`.


### Python setup check up

Check your Python version with the following commands:
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/checks/python_checker.sh)" 3.8.12
```

Run the following command to check if you successfully installed the required packages:
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/checks/pip_check.sh)"
```

Now run the following command to check if you can load these packages:
```bash
python -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/checks/pip_check.py)"
```

Make sure you can run Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

And open a `Python 3` notebook.

Make sure that you are running the correct python version in the notebook. Open a cell and run :
``` python
import sys; sys.version
```

Here you have it! A complete python virtual env with all the third-party packages you'll need for the whole bootcamp.


## Windows settings

### Exchange files between Windows and Ubuntu

We need an easy way to transfer files from Windows to Ubuntu and vice versa.

In order to do that, let's create shortcuts to Ubuntu directories in the Windows **File Explorer**:
- Open the Windows File Explorer (or use the shortcut `WIN` + `E`)
- In the Address Bar, enter `\\wsl$\` (or `\\wsl$\Ubuntu` if it does not work)
- You now have acces to the Ubuntu file system
- Dive into the Ubuntu file system in order to look for directories of interest
- Drag the desired folders into the Address Bar in order to create shortcuts

### Open the Windows File Explorer from the Ubuntu terminal

Another option to move files around is to open the Windows **File Explorer** from the Ubuntu terminal:
- Open an Ubuntu terminal
- Go to the directory you wish to explore
- Run the `wslview .`
- If you get an input output error message, run `wsl --shutdown` in a Windows PowerShell and reopen an Ubuntu terminal

### Find your way in the Ubuntu File System

You might want to figure out the exact location of a Windows directory in the Ubuntu file system, or the other way around.

In order to convert a Windows path to and from an Ubuntu path:
- Open an Ubuntu terminal
- Use the `wslpath "C:\Program Files"` command in order to translate a Windows path into an Ubuntu path
- Use the `wslpath -w "/home"` command in order to translate an Ubuntu path into a Windows path
- In particular, the `wslpath -w $(pwd)` command returns the Windows path of the current Ubuntu directory

## Visual C++ Redistributable

Some Python packages require a compiler to function properly. Let's install one:

[For x64 systems](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)


[For x86 systems](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

If you're unsure about which system you're using please ask for help.
